CSCI2270 Final

## Project Summary

Assume that our friends decided to sell items in a small online market they created. They want a program that can track their shop's content and allow the user to access their account inventory information easily. Simple operations that the program do will be "display present items in inventory", "add an item to inventory", "delete an item from inventory", "count the number of items in inventory", "import new inventory of items", "clear inventory" and "exit". The "inventory" is a list that is connected to the user's account and the program automatically updates the inventory data list when the user uploads an item to sell or if the item is sold etc.. from their shop. The program should be tested and approved by our friends before it is actually implemented and connected to the online market. Now, you can be one of our friends and test this program. Have fun and please let us know if you want to suggest some more things!
